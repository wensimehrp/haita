The default theme, _New Hamber_, also supports dark mode.

You can make a new project in Typst using Haita, set it to #link("https://github.com/typst/typst/pull/7964")[bundle
  export], and Haita would generate a site for you. You don't need to worry about setting up the toolchain – Typst is
the only tool required.

= An Unfinished Project

Haita is a decent choice for organizing long, comprehensive documentation. But just like Typst, Haita is an unfinished
project, and is (currently) not a serious tool. Specifically, it's missing these features:

- Internationalization support
- Built-in search functions (#link(<pagefind-integration>)[pagefind integration] available)

However, if you want pure Typst documentation, ease of use, and/or MathML formulae, you might want to give it a try. If
you want stability and extremely easy syntax, then maybe you should consider mdBook. If you have any issues, please feel
free to #link("https://github.com/wensimehrp/haita/issues")[open a ticket on GitHub]. If you would like to contribute,
please #link("https://github.com/wensimehrp/haita/pulls")[open a pull request].
